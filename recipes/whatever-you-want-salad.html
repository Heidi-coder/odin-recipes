    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>First up on our list of ADHD-friendly recipes, we've got Whatever-you-want salad! While this may sound like a cop-out for recipe-writing, I promise this will solve a lot of your meal worries. This is what saved me when I was sick of eating processed pre-made meals and wanted something healthier.</p>
    <p>The basic gist of this recipe is that you can go to the store and buy cans of food that look like they'll go well together and the occasional pre-washed fresh vegetable, if you so desire, and dump them in one large leftover container. Don't dump them in a bowl! It's worth it to invest in a large leftover container to avoid any more dirty dishes than are necessary.</p>
    <p>The following recipe is one version of whatever-you-want salad that I like and would recommend.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cans black beans</li>
        <li>2 cans corn</li>
        <li>1 can Hunts diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 stalks of pre-washed, pre-cut celery, optional</li>
        <li>Squeeze sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open and drain any cans of food.</li>
        <li>Dump all the canned food into the leftover container.</li>
        <li>Break, or cut if you feel like it, the celery stalks into the container.</li>
        <li>Stir it all up.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the desired amount of sour cream on top.</li>
        <li>Pro tip: Leave a spoon in the container in the fridge so you won't have to wash one every time you want to eat some. Unless, of course, it's a family dish and you don't all want to use the same spoon!</li>
    </ol>
